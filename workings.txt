Node:
    Contains information and methods for node objects.

Graph:
    Basically just a node list.

FormatOutput:
    Each method outputs a part of the table.

MainSearcher:
    Constructs the graph and runs the searches on it.


Searches:
    SearchIterativeDeepening:
        Depth first limited by an incrementing depth.
        Recursive function.

    SearchUniformSearch:
        Searches based on the shortest distances.
        Guaranteed to find the shortest route to each node.
        Will likely take a while.

    SearchBestFirst:
        Searches based on the value of each node.
        Works due to the way the graph is setup.
        Is better when using Euclidean or Manhattan distance.
